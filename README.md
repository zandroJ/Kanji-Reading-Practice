Public repo for my kanji reading practice after studying ANKI (only includes Kanji onyomi/kunyomi readings).
If u wanna download and test, make sure to run it on a localhost so that the JSON will load
can use python -m http.server
(this doesnt include the entire kanji vocab, only the ones learned after ANKI is added, JSON is updated manually)
