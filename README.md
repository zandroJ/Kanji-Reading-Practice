# Kanji Reading Practice

This is a public repository for my Kanji reading practice after studying ANKI. 

**Note:** The repository only includes Kanji **onyomi**/**kunyomi** readings. It does not include the entire Kanji vocabulary, just the ones learned after studying ANKI. The **JSON file is updated manually**.

## How to Use

If you want to download and test it locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the following command to start a local server and load the JSON:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server
