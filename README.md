### Key Updates:
1. **React-based App:** The app is now based on React, so the README mentions the steps to install dependencies using `npm`.
2. **Development Server:** Instead of using `python -m http.server`, use `npm start` to run a React development server.


# Kanji Reading Practice

This is a React-based web application for Kanji reading practice. The app focuses on testing **onyomi**/**kunyomi** readings, inspired by my study with ANKI. It allows you to practice by typing the correct reading of the displayed Kanji, and it provides immediate feedback.

**Note:** The repository includes Kanji **onyomi**/**kunyomi** readings and does not contain the entire Kanji vocabulary. It is based on the Kanji learned during my study with ANKI. The **JSON file with Kanji data is manually updated**.

## How to Use

If you want to download and test it locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanji-reading-practice.git
